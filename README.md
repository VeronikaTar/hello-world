# hello-world
Hello world! My name is Veronika, I am a Russian girl, but since February 2019 I live in the Netherlands.
I am an esthete and a nature lover. I like to learn languages and recently I decided to learn new one — the language of programming :-)
And as in any language, to express yourself fully and to be understood correctly it is important not just to speak (/to code) but also to have a good base of grammar and to be familiar with the history and cultural features of it. That's why I am here – in the course “Introduction to Computer Science”.  
I'd like to have this base of understanding the processes in my computer: how is works, how to improve it and how to make something completely new.
It is so exciting, isn't it?! :-)
